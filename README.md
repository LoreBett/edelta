### Eclipse update site

Copy the following URL and paste it into your Eclipse "Install New Software" dialog ("Help" => "Install New Software..."), wait for the list of available features to show and select the latest version of "Edelta Feature". (The URL is NOT meant to be opened with a browser)

https://dl.bintray.com/lorenzobettini/edelta/updates/

IMPORTANT: Edelta requires Xtext, if this is not already installed, all dependencies will be automatically installed form this update site, which is self-contained.

### Pre-configured Eclipse distributions with Edelta installed, for several architectures.

Download a complete Eclipse distribution with Edelta installed; choose the one for your OS and architecture: https://sourceforge.net/projects/edelta/files/products

**WARNING** If you downloaded one of Edelta Eclipse distributions earlier than version 0.3.x you won't be able to update it; please download a brand new Edelta Eclipse distribution with version at least 0.3.x (issue [#13](https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/edelta/issues/13)).
